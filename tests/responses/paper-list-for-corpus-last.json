These constructs (M1GS RNAs) have been used to determine some minimal features of model substrates. As few as 3 bp on the 3' side of the site of cleavage in a substrate complex and 1 nt on the 5' side are required for cleavage to occur, The cytosines in the 3' terminal CCA sequence of the model substrates are important for cleavage efficiency but not cleavage site selection. A purine (base-paired or not) at the 3' side of the cleavage site is important both for cleavage site selection and efficiency, M1GS RNAs provide both a simple system for characterization of the reaction governed by M1 RNA and a tool for gene therapy.","concrete":true,"cited_by":null,"citations":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/paper/?concrete=False&cited_by=4871&format=json","authors":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/author_instance/?paper=4871&format=json","institutions":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/institution_instance/?paper=4871&format=json","affilations":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/affiliation_instance/?paper=4871&format=json","metadata":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/metadatum/?paper=4871&format=json"},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/paper/4908/?format=json","id":4908,"corpus":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/corpus/1/?format=json","publication_date":1983,"title":"A G43 To U43 Mutation In Escherichia-Coli Transfer Rnatyrsu3+ Which Affects Processing By Rnase-P","volume":"11","issue":"5","journal":"NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH","abstract":null,"concrete":true,"cited_by":null,"citations":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/paper/?concrete=False&cited_by=4908&format=json","authors":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/author_instance/?paper=4908&format=json","institutions":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/institution_instance/?paper=4908&format=json","affilations":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/affiliation_instance/?paper=4908&format=json","metadata":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/metadatum/?paper=4908&format=json"},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/paper/4946/?format=json","id":4946,"corpus":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/corpus/1/?format=json","publication_date":1998,"title":"Improving The Efficiency Of Antisense And Egs Methods","volume":"8","issue":"1","journal":"ANTISENSE & NUCLEIC ACID DRUG DEVELOPMENT","abstract":"Hammerhead ribozymes and stable stem loop structures function as inhibitors of 3'-5'-exonuclease degradation of external guide sequences (EGSs) when covalently linked to the 3'-end of EGS RNAs.

This reaction converts C5 protein, or its single cysteine-substituted mutant derivatives, into chemical nucleases which are capable of cleaving the cognate RNA Ligand, M1 RNA, the catalytic RNA subunit of E. coli RNase P, in the presence of ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide. Cleavages in M1 RNA are expected to occur at positions proximal to the site of contact between the modified residue (in C5 protein) and the ribose units in M1 RNA. When EPD-Fe was used to modify residue Cys16 in C5 protein, hydroxyl radical-mediated cleavages occurred predominantly in the P3 helix of M1 RNA present in the reconstituted holoenzyme. C5 Cys54-EDTA-Fe produced cleavages on the 5' strand of the P4 pseudoknot of M1 RNA, while the cleavages promoted by C5 Cys66-EDTA-Fe were in the loop connecting helices P18 and P2 (J18/2) and the loop (J2/4) preceding the 3' strand of the P4 pseudoknot. However, hydroxyl radical-mediated cleavages in M1 RNA were not evident with Cys113-EDTA-Fe, perhaps indicative of Cys113 being distal from the RNA-protein interface in the RNase P holoenzyme. Our directed hydroxyl radical-mediated footprinting experiments indicate that conserved residues in the RNA and protein subunit of the RNase-P holoenzyme are adjacent to each other and provide structural information essential for understanding the assembly of RNase P.
